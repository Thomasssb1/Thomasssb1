## Hey, I am Thomas
### What am I currently working on?
Mostly working on rebuilding Bird Tracker from the ground up by using AWS RDS, Spring Boot and redesigning the front-end entirely (still using Flutter). <br>
Currently, I am also trying to learn some more React so I can begin to create apps using React Native.
