## Things I have worked on
Most, if not all, of my projects are uploaded under the name [Red Shock Entertainment](https://github.com/red-shock) ![Red Shock Entertainment logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134847576?s=20&v=4), this is a group where most work is uploaded which is either collaboratory or made solo by me.
- Bird Tracker - Flutter, Dart, Supabase, Tensorflow, Python <br>
  Not currently released, but you can see the [youtube video](https://youtu.be/RZ105B2EbC4) I created to show it off as it was my A-Level computer science project. 
- [reddit-2-video](https://github.com/Thomasssb1/reddit-2-video) - Dart, FFmpeg
- [ytdl](https://github.com/Thomasssb1/ytdl), [Offline Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redshock.offline_music) - Flutter, Dart
- [Yes No Rubber](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RedShockEntertainment.YesNoRubber), [Planet Conquest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RedshockEntertainment.PlanetConquestRemastered) - C#, Unity, Asesprite <br>

I also have alot of personal projects such as bots which interact with specific APIS in order to automate actions on the web. For example, I have several discord bots which allow for interactivity with the web by user input within discord. These are all written in python using discord.py.

### What am I currently working on?
Mostly working on rebuilding Bird Tracker to support Supabase as well as a UI overhaul in order to release it on the Play Store.
